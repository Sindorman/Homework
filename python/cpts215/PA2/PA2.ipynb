    "An amortized loan is a loan where the principal of the loan is paid down over the life a loan (that is, amortized) according to an amortization schedule. Each payment to the lender will consist of a portion of interest and a portion of principal. Mortgage loans are typically amortizing loans. The calculations for an amortizing loan are those of an annuity using the time value of money formulas, and can be done using an amortization calculator."

    "For this programming assignment, we are going to implement the k-means clustering algorithm in Jupyter Notebook. Cluster analysis seeks to separate objects into groups (or clusters), such that the objects within a group are more similar to each other than they are to objects in other groups. For example, we could cluster students by locations of their hometowns, stocks by a list of their closing prices over some interval of time, news articles based on the similarity of the words they contain, or types of cancer based on the profiles of genes that are active.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem set studies cluster analysis of data defined by an array of numerical feature values. So a student's hometown location array might just have a latitude and longitude. A stock's array would have a price for each day. For news story aggregation, each article might have the numbers of occurrences of various words. And for the example dataset that we'll actually use here, each patient will be characterized by an array of gene expression levels, indicating for each gene a kind of relative abundance for that patient.\n",

    "The goal will be to take a set of such samples and find common groups (k of them!).\n"
